## Introduction

Welcome to my OpenGL 3D Environment project! This project was developed as part of my CS-330 course, where I aimed to create a realistic 3D environment using OpenGL. Through this project, I learned valuable design and development skills, pushing my boundaries and expanding my knowledge in the realm of 3D graphics and OpenGL.


### Designing Software

I approached designing the software by first identifying a familiar real-world scene to recreate in the virtual environment. This helped me establish a personal connection with the project and added depth to the final result. To achieve this, I adopted a math-driven approach, ensuring accurate proportions and spatial relationships between objects. My design skills improved as I visualized real-world concepts as graphical representations in OpenGL, translating everyday objects into collections of triangles.

This project honed my skills in designing virtual environments, understanding the importance of proportionality, spatial relationships, and user interaction. I also refined my ability to translate real-world concepts into graphical elements using OpenGL.

### Design Process

My design process involved referencing real-world settings, utilizing math for proportional scaling, and experimenting iteratively to ensure the scene's accuracy. This process allowed me to create an immersive 3D environment that closely resembles the original setting.

The design tactics I employed, such as personalization, proportionality, and iterative design, can be applied in future projects to enhance user engagement and realism.


### Developing Programs

My approach to developing programs for the OpenGL 3D Environment project was characterized by a combination of modular programming principles and object-oriented techniques. This strategic approach allowed me to create a codebase that is not only functional but also highly organized and easily maintainable.

I employed the concept of modular programming, breaking down the project into smaller, self-contained components. Each of these components was designed to encapsulate specific functionalities, such as handling user input, rendering objects, managing shaders, and controlling the camera. By compartmentalizing these functionalities into custom functions, I ensured that the codebase remained readable, coherent, and well-structured.

One of the key advantages of using modular programming was the improved clarity it brought to the code. By isolating specific functionalities into separate functions, I could focus on the implementation details of each component without becoming overwhelmed by the entire project. This approach allowed me to troubleshoot issues more efficiently, as I could pinpoint problems within specific modules and address them without disrupting the entire codebase.

In addition to modular programming, I leveraged the power of object-oriented programming (OOP) to enhance the reusability and consistency of my code. I created header files and classes to encapsulate related functionalities and data structures. For example, I organized my shaders, buffers, cameras, and textures into separate files, each containing their respective classes. This separation of concerns made it easier to manage these crucial components, as well as to add new ones in the future.

The use of classes not only promoted reusability but also established a clear and intuitive structure within the codebase. Each class represented a distinct entity with its own properties and behaviors. This separation allowed me to maintain a clean and concise main program file, which primarily dealt with coordinating these classes and their interactions.

### Development Strategies

 I integrated key inputs for both movement and camera control. The WASD keys were employed to replicate movement in the horizontal plane, allowing users to navigate forward, left, backward, and right within the virtual environment. Additionally, I leveraged the QE keys to simulate vertical movement, enabling users to ascend and descend within the 3D space. This combination of keys effectively emulated the standard movement controls found in many contemporary video games, fostering familiarity and ease of use. I introduced the use of the left mouse button click to enable users to control the camera's orientation. When the left mouse button was clicked, the cursor was hidden, and the camera's movement became tied to the mouse's motion. This feature gave users the freedom to look around and explore the environment from different perspectives, mirroring the camera controls commonly seen in games like Minecraft..
 
Other Development strategies that were used in the development of this OpenGL project, consist of the use of GLM and CMath to help with iterative and mathematical parts of the development to make the program better overall and easier to read. Mathematical Functions became very useful when using Scaling and transitions for objects that are relative to one another. Though, I wish that I would have used this more in the developmet process.

## Computer Science and Future Goals

My future goals with my study of Computer Science is to impact the futurism of technology and make the world a better & more productive place with the use of technology. While OpenGL is not my strong suit, and I may not pursue a career in computer graphics. I enjoyed studying the relvancy of it and understanding why it is important in the technological world.

Computer science equips me with problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and the ability to create innovative solutions. These skills are essential in pursuing my future goals, both academically and professionally.
This project expanded my knowledge in computational graphics and visualization. I gained insight into translating real-world scenes into digital environments, enhancing my ability to communicate complex concepts visually.
